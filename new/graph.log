Collapsing

Start collapsing:
set()
	ATG is a source
		Iterate over intermediate vertices
			Source, Inter, Dest - ATG TGC GCC
				Extend edge with source, inter, dest ATG TGC GCC
		Add TGC to obsolete
{'TGC'}
	TGC is a source
	TGC is in obsolete - skip
{'TGC'}
	GCC is a source
		Iterate over intermediate vertices
			Source, Inter, Dest - GCC CCA CAT
				Extend edge with source, inter, dest GCC CCA CAT
		Add CCA to obsolete
{'CCA', 'TGC'}
	CCA is a source
	CCA is in obsolete - skip
{'CCA', 'TGC'}
	CAT is a source
		Iterate over intermediate vertices
			Source, Inter, Dest - CAT ATG TGC
				TGC is obsolete
				Add source CAT
				Add link from source CAT to inter ATG
				Add unchanged edge between CAT ATG
		Add ATG to obsolete
--> Number of vertices in graph is 5
